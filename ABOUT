Basically this was original written very elegantly in C, interrupt driven etc. 
Unfortunately this did not fit on the chip so it was rewritten in a crude, main loop,
non-interrupt driven assembly. This was a compromise between easy to write/debug (
limited time), elegance and size.

Rules:
As a compromise between niceness & smallness routines are allowed to use any registers
they want (save registers before calling a routine).
